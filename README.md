# Python Text RPG

![logo](/assets/python_text_adventure_logo_small.png)

README is under construction!

## How to Play

You will need to install Python to play (obviously). You can learn how to install it if you go to the [Python Website](https://www.python.org/).

Also, you will need to install the `rich` library for Python. You can do so with pip: `python -m pip install rich`

If it gives an error like `error: externally-managed-environment`, you may have to install it with your operating systems package manager.

Here are some examples:

- Debian based systems (like Ubuntu): `sudo apt install python3-rich`
- Arch Linux based systems: `sudo pacman -S python-rich`
- Solus: `sudo eopkg install python-rich`

Once that is done, you can run the game by opening a terminal in the root directory of the game, and running the command `python main.py`.

## Languages

There are plans to add extra languages to the game.

**Currently supported languages:**

- English (yeah that's it for now, sorry)

Support for extra languages may take a while, since I only know English (since I'm from the US), some Spanish, and a little bit of German.
